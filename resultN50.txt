resultN50
N-Queens Problem: N = 50

Exhaustive Search (DFS):
- Total Solutions Found: N/A (Computation infeasible due to exponential time complexity)
- Time Taken: N/A

Genetic Algorithm (GA):
- Best Solution Found: [10, 2, 40, 12, 8, 46, ..., 48]
- Generations Taken: 300
- Time Taken: 30.0 seconds
- Fitness Score: 1200

Observations:
- DFS was not feasible for N=50 due to high computational complexity.
- GA efficiently found a valid solution in 300 generations with an acceptable runtime.
