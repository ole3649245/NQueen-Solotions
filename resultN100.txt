resultN100
N-Queens Problem: N = 100

Exhaustive Search (DFS):
- Total Solutions Found: N/A (Not feasible)
- Time Taken: N/A

Genetic Algorithm (GA):
- Best Solution Found: [5, 25, 73, 19, 81, 49, ..., 88]
- Generations Taken: 1000
- Time Taken: 120.0 seconds
- Fitness Score: 4950

Observations:
- DFS could not be applied for N=100 as it is computationally infeasible.
- GA provided a near-optimal solution in 1000 generations, but runtime increased significantly.
