 N-Queens Solutions

This repository contains solutions for the N-Queens problem using two approaches:
1. **Exhaustive Search (DFS)**: A depth-first search implementation to find all possible solutions.
2. **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**: A heuristic approach to find optimal solutions efficiently.

## Files
- `ExhaustiveSearch.py`: Python script for solving the N-Queens problem using Exhaustive Search.
- `GeneticAlgorithm.py`: Python script for solving the N-Queens problem using Genetic Algorithm.
- `resultN10.txt`: Results for N=10.
- `resultN50.txt`: Results for N=50.
- `resultN100.txt`: Results for N=100.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
2. Run the scripts with Python:
3. Review the results in the results folder or the terminal output.

## Results Overview
- Exhaustive Search is computationally feasible only for small N (e.g., N=10).
- Genetic Algorithm scales well to larger values of N but does not guarantee all solutions.
